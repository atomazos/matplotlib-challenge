I created the following four visualizations to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo), which were administered to 250 mice in a study, compare over the course of 45 days:

* Scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment:

* Scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment:

* Scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate):

* Bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days:

KEY OBSERVATIONS REGARDING THE PYMACEUTICALS STUDY

Overall, of the four relevant treatments under consideration - namely, Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) - we found that Capomulin seems the most promising and effective in treating tumors in mice. Below, you will find three key observations we concldued from the study data:
1.  Capomulin is the only treatment for which tumor volume decreases over a 45 day period in mice.
2.  Over 45 days of treatment, Capomulin has the least increase in metastatic sites.
3.  Capomulin has the highest survival rate with 21 of 25 mice survival over 45 days of treatment.
