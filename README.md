# matplotlib-challenge

I created the following four visualizations to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo), which were administered to 250 mice in a study, compare over the course of 45 days:

Scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.


Scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.

Scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)

Bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.

Include 3 observations about the results of the study. Use the visualizations you generated from the study data as the basis for your observations.
